# HTMX Sidebar Blocks (Web Components + Alpine + HTMX)

These files are **standalone HTMX artifacts** intended to be viewed in an **iframe + Shadow DOM** execution environment to prevent style bleed. [5]

Each example includes:
- HTMX via CDN (2.x) [11]
- Alpine.js via CDN for state management [11]
- All CSS included in-file (tokenized / borderless) [6]
- Web Components implemented as ES classes + Shadow DOM for encapsulation [5]

Open any `sidebar-XX-*.html` directly in a browser.
